# Overview

This is a web-based Headphone Latency Tester application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tool is designed to measure audio latency in headphones or audio devices through a browser interface. It provides a precise, user-friendly way to assess the actual audio delay between when sound is generated and when it's heard through audio equipment. The app uses professional-grade timing techniques and averages 20 measurements for accurate results.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Pure Vanilla Web Stack**: Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any frameworks or build tools
- **Single Page Application**: Self-contained in a single HTML file for maximum portability and simplicity
- **Modern CSS Design**: Utilizes CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layouts, CSS gradients for visual appeal, and backdrop-filter for glassmorphism effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes

## Audio Processing
- **Web Audio API**: Leverages browser's native Web Audio API for precise audio generation and timing measurements
- **Real-time Analysis**: Implements audio analysis capabilities for measuring latency between audio output and input
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Designed to work across modern browsers that support Web Audio API

## User Interface
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern UI with translucent backgrounds and blur effects
- **Interactive Controls**: Button-based interface for starting/stopping tests and configuring parameters
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time display of test results and audio analysis data

# External Dependencies

## Browser APIs
- **Web Audio API**: Core dependency for audio generation, processing, and analysis
- **MediaDevices API**: Used for microphone access to capture audio input for latency measurements
- **Performance API**: Utilized for high-precision timing measurements

## No External Libraries
- No third-party JavaScript libraries or frameworks
- No external CSS frameworks
- No build tools or package managers required
- Completely self-contained application that runs directly in the browser
